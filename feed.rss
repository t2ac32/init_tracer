## Creating a form
Forms are scroling lists of static controls like text and images, but can also include user interactive controls like text fields, toggle switches, buttons and more.

To create a basic form:
</code></pre><p>var body: some View { Form { Text("Hello, Tracer!").padding() }</p><pre><code>
*Limitations:* SwiftUI only allows 10 items to be added to a form. This limit applies to all childen inside a paren in SwiftUI.

## Groups
To add more than 10 children to a form we can use *Group* structs.
This doesn't change the look but works around the 10 children limitation.

## Sections
This applies a change of look to forms by splitting the items into chunks or sections. Sections split forms into discrete visual groups just like the settings app does:
</code></pre><p>Form { Section { Text("Hello, world!") }</p><p>Section { Text("Hello, world!") Text("Hello, world!") } }</p><pre><code>
# **Navigation:** NavigationView and bars

## Adding navigation bars
</code></pre><p>var body: some View { NavigationView { Form { Section { Text("Hello, Tracer!") }</p><p>Section { Text("This is section 2.") Text("Hello, world!") } }.navigationTitle("test bar") }.navigationBarTitle("Navbar title").navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)</p><p>}</p><pre><code>
# Modifying program state
SwiftUI’s views are a function of their state, we mean that the way your user interface looks – the things people can see and what they can interact with – are determined by the state of your program.

</code></pre><p>struct ContentView: View { var tapCount = 0</p><p>var body: some View { Button("Tap Count: (tapCount)") { tapCount += 1 } } }</p><pre><code>
ContentView is a struct, structs are *immutable , the code above will give us an mutability error.

## *property wrapper*
Property wrappers are special attributes we can place before our properties that effectively gives them super-powers.

## @State wrapper
**@State** allows us to work around the limitation of structs: we know we can’t change their properties because structs are fixed, but @State allows that value to be stored separately by SwiftUI in a place that can be modified.

</code></pre><p>struct ContentView: View { @State var tapCount = 0</p><p>var body: some View { Button("Tap Count: (tapCount)") { self.tapCount += 1 } } }</p><pre><code>***Tip:*  @State is specifically designed for simple properties that are stored in one view. As a result, Apple recommends we add private access control to those properties, like this:    

</code></pre><p>@State private var tapCount = 0.</p><pre><code>
## Binding state to UI controls

The problem is that Swift differentiates between “show the value of this property here” and “show the value of this property here, but write any changes back to the property.”

## *two-way binding*
We bind the text field so that it shows the value of our property, but we also bind it so that any changes to the UI CONTROL also update the property.

In Swift, we mark these two-way bindings with a special symbol so they stand out: we write a *dollar sign* before them.

</code></pre><p>struct ContentView: View { @State private var name = ""</p><p>var body: some View { Form { TextField("Enter your name", text: $name) Text("Hello, world!") } } }</p><pre><code>
## Views in a loop
### The forEach view:
This SwfitUI view can loop over arrays and ranges, creating as many views as needed. Even better, this view doesn't get git by the 10-view limit.

ForEeach runs a closure once for every item it loops over, passing in the current loop item.

For example, this creates a form with 100 rows:
</code></pre><p>Form { ForEach(0..&lt;100) { number in Text("Row (number)") } }</p><p>shorthanded version since ForEach passes a closure Form { ForEach(0..&lt;100) { number in Text("Row ($0)") } }</p><pre><code>### Use case
ForEach is particularly useful when working with SwiftUI’s Picker view,
Example define a view that:

1. Has an array of possible student names.
2. Has an @State property storing the currently selected student.
3. Creates a Picker view asking users to select their favorite, using a two-way binding to the @State property.
4. Uses ForEach to loop over all possible student names, turning them into a text view.

</code></pre><p>struct ContentView: View { let students = ["Harry", "Hermione", "Ron"] @State private var selectedStudent = "Harry"</p><p>var body: some View { NavigationView { Form { Picker("Select your student", selection: $selectedStudent) { ForEach(students, id: .self) { Text($0) } } } } } }</p><pre><code>- **note:**  *id: \.self* part is important. This exists because SwiftUI needs to be able to identify every view on the screen uniquely, so it can detect when things change. 
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/first-post%20copy</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/first-post%20copy</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:53:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/first-post</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/first-post</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:53:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%202</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%202</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:53:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%203</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%203</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:53:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%204</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%204</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:53:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%205</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%205</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:53:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%206</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://t2ac32.github.io/init_tracer/blog/post%20copy%206</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:53:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
